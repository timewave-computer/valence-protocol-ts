# @valence-protocol/valence-domain-clients-core

This package provides core abstract classes for blockchain client implementations in the Valence Protocol ecosystem.

## Abstract Classes

- `ChainClient`: Base class for read/query operations on a blockchain.
- `SigningChainClient`: Extends `ChainClient` to support signing and sending transactions.

Implement these classes to support specific blockchains or signing mechanisms.
